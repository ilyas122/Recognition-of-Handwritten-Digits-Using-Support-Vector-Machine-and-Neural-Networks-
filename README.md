# Recognition-of-Handwritten-Digits-Using-Support-Vector-Machine-and-Neural-Networks 
Handwritten Character Recognition is a field of image processing as well as pattern recognition. There are two approaches for the pattern recognition such as statistical and structural. Handwritten digit recognition system can be divided into four stages.

•	Data acquisition
•	Pre-processing
•	Feature extraction
•	Classification

Preprocessing prepares image for feature extraction. Some of the common preprocessing steps are binarization, centering, morphological operations and more. Feature extraction is very important step and success of the classification strongly depends on it. Classification in computer science represents prediction of class or label for an object based on its similarity with previous objects.

Currently, hybrid model of RNN and CNN is used for this kind of recognition problem to determine the hand written digit and convert it into a digital one. A Recurrent Neural Network is a class of artificial neural networks where connections between nodes form a directed graph along a temporal sequence. CNNs use image recognition and classification in order to detect objects, recognize faces, etc. They are made up of neurons with learnable weights and biases.

We are proposing much lighter algorithm for the problem, Support Vector Machine. SVM discovers a hyperplane that separates data from different classes. Each instance is labeled with one of existing classes and they are represented as points in space. SVM builds a model based on instances from training set and further classification of unknown instances is done by that model.
